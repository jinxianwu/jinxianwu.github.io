I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [School of Automation](https://ac.bit.edu.cn/), [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), and I am supervised by [Prof. Li Dai](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=WDrzqT8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Yuanqing Xia](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=HtedN3oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My research focuses on distributed model predictive control (DMPC), specifically on the iterative DMPC methods for linear/nonlinear systems with nonlinear coupled constraints or costs, and the distributed optimization methods for DMPC.
